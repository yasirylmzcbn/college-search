# College Search
This was a high school project where we were to traverse a 7100 x 2000 .csv file to determine certain metrics about colleges in the U.S. For example, we had to find out which states had the greatest number of schools, which schools had the highest tuitions, etc.

We also wrote unit tests to ensure we were grabbing the correct data.
